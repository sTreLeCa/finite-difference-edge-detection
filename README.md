# Finite Difference Edge Detection

This project explores edge detection in images using central finite difference approximations of image derivatives. It includes Python implementations using OpenCV and NumPy, demonstrating the effect of varying the degree of the finite difference approximation. A real-time camera version is also included.

## Features

*   Implementation of edge detection using central finite difference kernels.
*   Comparison of edge detection results using different degrees (1 to 6) of the finite difference approximation.
*   Visualization of results on a sample image (`orangegutang.jpg`).
*   Real-time edge detection demonstration using a webcam (`cameraedge.py`).
*   Detailed explanation of concepts and results in the Typst documentation (`Description.typ`).
